### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a full stack developer with a strong interest in clean architecture, automation, and making complex systems easy to work with.  
My current toolkit revolves around **C#**, **TypeScript**, and **Go**, building for both frontend and backend — often in the same day, usually with a coffee nearby ☕.  

I like to think of my work as building bridges between ideas and production, with a few CI/CD pipelines running underneath.

**Frontend:** React, Vite, Next.js  
**Backend:** .NET, Go, Node.js

### 🚀 What I’ve Been Working On

- Building and maintaining microservices for payments and integrations  
- Developing internal frameworks and component libraries for frontend teams  
- Automating builds and deployments through GitHub Actions and Kubernetes  
- Writing backend services that are fast, testable, and production-friendly  
- Occasionally shaving 10 minutes off a pipeline for the thrill of it

### 💡 Core Principles

- Keep it **simple**, even when it’s distributed  
- Make it **secure** by design  
- **Automate** everything  
- Write code your future self will understand (and forgive)
